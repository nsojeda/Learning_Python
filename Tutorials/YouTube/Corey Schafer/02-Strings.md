Video Title: "Python Tutorial for Beginners 2: Strings - Working with Textual Data"
Description: In this Python Beginner Tutorial, we will begin learning about the string data type. Strings allow us to work with textual data in Python. We will be going over different ways to format strings, and a

# Variable Naming Conventions
---
## Conventions

- Variables are usually all lowercase 
- If a Variables has multiple words then we separate those with underscore ( _ )
- Variable names should be as descriptive as possible

``` python
message = "Hello World"
my_message = "Hello, Nick!"

pi=3.14

print(message)
print(my_message)
print(pi)
```
## Bad Practices

- Single Letter
	  May be valid variable name, but if anyone reads the code now wouldn't know what value it's supposed to hold

```python
m = "Hello World"

print(m)
```
# String Quotes and Escaping
---
## String Quotes
Strings can made by using Single( ' ' ) or double( " " ) quotes.

```python
print('Hello World')
print("Hello World")
```

You can alternate quotes depending on the text going in the string. 

```python
print('He said, "Hello World"')
print("Bobby's World!")
```

Using the same quotes make will make the interrupter think the string is ends before it does. which will lead to a, SyntaxError: invalid syntax.

```python
print('Bobby's World!)

```

## Escaping
You can use a backslash( \ ) escape or tell the interrupter to not to use that quote to close the string.

```python
print('Bobby\'s World!')
print("He said, \"Hello World\"")
```

# Multi-line Strings
---
By using three quotes you can print on multi-line 
You can use Single( ''' ) or double( """ ) quotes

```python
print("""
1,
2,
3,
""")
```

# String Length and Indexing
---
## Length
You can use len( ) to find the length, the number of letter in a string or variable

```python
message = "Hello World"
print(len(message))

print(len("""Bobby's World
was a popular animated television show
that aired from 1990 to 1998. """))
```

## Indexing
Every letter in string or variable is index with a number starting with 0. 

We can print the letter by know it's index. 

So with our message the letter of the first index (index 0) is H and our last letter (index10) is d

```python
message = "Hello World"

print(message[0])

print(message[10])

```

If we try to print an index that's not in the range of our message, we get an IndexError: string index out of range

```python
print(message[11])
```
